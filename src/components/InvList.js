//the UI for displaying the list of inventory items
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class InvList extends Component {
    render() {
        return (

        )
    }
}



// This component will need state.
// state setting for Inventory List data - will be moved to the main parent component
// state = {
//     invList: data,
// }

// Be sure to create an individual item component.

// This component will also be used to display the inventory for a single warehouse.Your fetch to the API will differ depending on if there is a warehouse_id prop or not. Be sure to collaborate with the person who has the ticket “Front - End: Warehouse Inventory List“.

// Note: If the inventory endpoint on the back - end is not complete, use fake data until it is ready to be hooked up.
