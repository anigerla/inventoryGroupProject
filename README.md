## General info
This project is an inventory website that displays a list of total items in the inventory, a warehouse list, individual inventory items, warehouse locations and a list of items held by a specific warehouse. This is a single-page application (SPA) that displays the above data upon user request. The technology used to create the frontend is React, Javascript and HTML. The backend server is run on Node.js express package and the data comes in a data array file (there is no third-party database serving the data to the website).

This is a group project. I was responsible for inventory list component (frontend and backend) and general backend server setup.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React & Javascript
* HTML5 & CSS3, Sass
* npm router and express packages
* Node.js
	
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
To start the application:
$ cd into the directory that stores downloaded starter package
$ npm install --> installs all the dependent packages (the starter codes come together with the starter folder)
$ npm start --> starts the application itself

To start the server:
*the application will not load data from backend .json files unless the server is started,
therefore the website will look incomplete
Start another terminal window (there should be two now: one running the application and another for the server)
$ node server.js
*whenever you make any changes in the backend, you need to stop and restart the server 
(if you have nodemon, the process is done automatically)

```
